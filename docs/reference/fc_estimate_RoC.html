    <h2 class="hasAnchor" id="details"><a class="anchor" href="#details"></a>Details</h2>

    <p>R-Ratepol is written as an R package and includes a range of possible settings including a novel method to evaluate RoC in a single stratigraphical sequence using assemblage data and age uncertainties for each level. There are multiple built-in dissimilarity coefficients (DC) for different types of assemblage data, and various levels of data smoothing that can be applied depending on the type and variance of the data. In addition, R-Ratepol can use randomisation, accompanied by use of age uncertainties of each level and taxon standardisation to detect RoC patterns in datasets with high data noise or variability (i.e. numerous rapid changes in composition or sedimentation rates).</p>

<p>The computation of RoC in R-Ratepol is performed using the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Assemblage and age-model data are extracted from the original source and should be compiled together, i.e. depth, age, variable (taxon) 1, variable (taxon) 2, etc.</p>
<p>2. (optional) Smoothing of assemblage data: Each variable within the assemblage data is smoothed using one of five in-built smoothing methods: none (<code>smooth_method = "none"</code>), Shepard's 5-term filter (<code>smooth_method = "shep"</code>; Davis, 1986; Wilkinson, 2005), moving average (<code>smooth_method = "m.avg"</code>), age-weighted average (<code>smooth_method = "age.w"</code>), Grimm's smoothing (<code>smooth_method = "grim"</code>; Grimm and Jacobson, 1992).</p>
<p>3. Creation of time bins: A template for all time bins in all window movements is created.</p>
<p>4.  A single run (an individual loop) is computed:</p>
<p>- (optional) Selection of one time series from age uncertainties (see section 2.1.1.2. on randomisation)</p>    
<p>- Subsetting levels in each bin: Here the working units (WU) are defined</p>
<p>- (optional) Standardisation of assemblage data in each WU</p>
    
<p>- The summary of a single run is produced based on all moving windows
- Calculation of RoC between WUs: RoC is calculated as the dissimilarity coefficient (DC) standardised by age differences between WUs. Five in-built dissimilarity coefficients are available: Euclidean distance (`DC = "euc`), standardised Euclidean distance (<code>DC = "euc.sd}), Chord distance (\code{DC = "chord</code>), Chi-squared coefficient (<code>DC = "chisq}; Prentice, 1980), Gower's distance (\code{DC = "gower</code>; Gower, 1971), Bray-Curtis istance (<code>DC = "bray"</code>). The choice of DC depends on the type of assemblage data. In addition, RoC between WUs be calculated using every consecutive WU (<code>only_subsequent = FALSE</code>), or alternatively, calculation of RoC can be restricted to only directly adjacent WUs (<code>only_subsequent = TRUE</code>). Using the former increases the number of samples for which RoC can be calculated within a sequence, which varies in terms of sample resolution, but may still introduce biases related to the RoC estimation as a result of the varying inter-sample distances.</p>
<p>5. Step 4 is repeated multiple times (e.g. 10,000 times).</p>
<p>6. Validation and summary of results from all runs of RoC calculation are produced.</p>
<p>7. (Optional) Data beyond a certain age can be excluded.</p>

<p>Selection of working units (WU; Step 3)</p>
<p>RoC is calculated between consecutive Working Units (WU). Traditionally, these WUs represent individual stratigraphical levels. However, changes in sedimentation rates and sampling strategies can result in an uneven temporal distribution of levels within a time sequence, which in turn makes the comparison of RoC between sequences problematic. There are various methods that attempt to minimise such problems. The first is interpolation of levels to evenly spaced time intervals, and the use of the interpolated data as WUs. This can lead to a loss of information when the density of levels is high. Second is binning of levels: assemblage data are pooled into age brackets of various size (i.e. time bins) and these serve as WUs. Here, the issue is a lower resolution of WUs and their uneven size in terms of total assemblage count (bins with more levels have higher assemblage counts). Third is selective binning: like classical binning, bins of selected size are created, but instead of pooling assemblage data together, only one level per time bin is selected as representative of each bin. This results in an even number of WUs in bins with a similar count size in the assemblage. However, the issue of low resolution remains. 
Therefore, we propose a new method of binning with a moving window, which is a compromise between using individual levels and selective binning. This method follows a simple sequence: time bins are created, levels are selected as in selective binning, and RoC between bins is calculated. However, the brackets of the time bin (window) are then moved forward by a selected amount of time (Z), levels are selected again (subset into bins), and RoC calculated for the new set of WUs. This is repeated X times (where X is the bin size divided by Z) while retaining all the results. 
R-Ratepol currently provides several options for selecting WU, namely as individual levels (<code>Working_Units = "levels"</code>), selective binning of levels (<code>Working_Units = "bins"</code>), and our new method of binning with a moving window (<code>Working_Units = "MW"</code>)</p>

<p>Randomisation</p>
<p>Due to the inherent statistical errors in uncertainties in the age estimates from age-depth and the assemblage datasets (e.g. pollen counts in each level; Birks and Gordon, 1985), R-Ratepol can be run several times and the results summarised (Steps 5-6). Therefore, two optional settings are available by using age uncertainties and assemblage data standardisation.</p>
<p>Age uncertainties</p>
<p>For each run, a single age sequence from the age uncertainties is randomly selected. The calculation between two consecutive WUs (i.e. one working-unit combination) results in a RoC score and a time position (which is calculated as the mean age position of the two WUs). However, due to random sampling of the age sequence, each WU combination will result in multiple RoC values. The final RoC value for a single WU combination is calculated as the median of the scores from all randomisations. In addition, the 95th quantile from all randomisations is calculated as an error estimate.
The final RoC value for a single WU combination is calculated as the median of the scores from all randomisations. In addition, the 95th quantile from all randomisations is calculated as an error estimate.</p>

<p>Data standardisation (Step 4b)</p>
<p>Taxa in the assemblage dataset can be standardised to a certain count (e.g. number of pollen grains in each WU) by rarefaction. Random sampling without replacement is used to draw a selected number of individuals from each WU (e.g. 150 pollen grains).</p>
