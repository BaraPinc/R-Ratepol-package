\title{
Standardies community data
}
\description{
Each Working Unit (sample) is standardised to the same number of individuals (default value = 150), using random sampling of individuals without replacement. The dataset is reduced by excluding all WUs without any individuals and all taxa without any counts.
}
\usage{
fc_standardise_community_data(data_source, N_individuals = 150, Debug = F)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data_source}{

}
  \item{N_individuals}{
Number of individuals to perform standardisation to. The N_individuals is automatically adjusted to the smallest  number of individuals in dataset. 
}
  \item{Debug}{
Show messages from internal processes
}
